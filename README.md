# country-GDP-prediction

Analysis of country's level of development based on GDP, Population and other weighted parameters, like Tax Burden. Pandas, ML, Exploratory

# What's in it:
- raw .csv file coming from https://www.heritage.org/index/, formatted by Kaggle
- a lot of graphs made in Exploratory, a dataviz/ML tool
- an .ipynb file used in my presentation, coupling database with list of developed countries from Wikipedia
- downloadable notebook HTML file with all clickable graphs

# Conclusions:
- one of the main predictors of developed country status is Property Rights. More your property is protected by law, better is your economy  
- that same developed status of a country in most of the cases can be predicted wit 95% accuracy
